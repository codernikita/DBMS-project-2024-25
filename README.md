This project focuses on the development of a Pet Care Management System using
LiveSQL to create an efficient and well-structured database solution. The aim is to
simplify and organize the management of pet care services, which include pet boarding,
caretaker assignment, health monitoring, appointment scheduling, and payment
tracking. The system is designed to handle data for various stakeholders such as pet
owners, pets, caretakers, and veterinary staff, ensuring secure and consistent access to
important information.
